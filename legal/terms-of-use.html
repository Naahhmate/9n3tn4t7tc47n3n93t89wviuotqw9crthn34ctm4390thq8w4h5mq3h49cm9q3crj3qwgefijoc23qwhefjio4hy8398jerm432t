You may only apply for an Account, and use the applicable Services under such Account, if you are a legal entity formed and registered in the United States and can form a binding contract with Vergo.  Any use of or access to the Services for consumer or non-commercial purposes by any individual who is not a User is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.  For the purposes of these Terms, a “User” is your employee, contractor, agent, or other individual permitted to use your Account on your behalf.<br/><br/>You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your Vergo User ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission.  You agree to be responsible for: (a) the accuracy of all information that you provide to us; (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of any passwords or other Account identifiers that you choose or that are assigned to you; and (c) all activities that occur under such password(s) or Account(s).<br/><br/>Opening an Account provides you with access to a deposit account and debit cards (“Cards”) provided by one of our Banking Providers, as well as other functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time. Each Account must have at least one Representative who will manage the Account (for example, add, remove, or manage additional Representatives and Users; request and manage Cards for Users; view transactions and run reports; provide or update the profile; connect with third-party services, and other accounts to your Account; and perform other tasks to manage your Account). <br/><br/>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).<br/><br/>You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.<br/><br/>You will not share your Vergo User ID, Account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your Vergo User ID, Account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your Vergo User ID and Account. In the event that your Account or Vergo User ID is used without your consent or that you discover any other breach of security, you agree to promptly notify us using the contact information specified below. We are not responsible for your failure to comply with this clause, or for any delay in shutting down your Account after you have reported a breach of security to us.<br/><br/><span class="bold">What about messaging?<br/><br/></span>As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the Services, including messages that Vergo sends you (for example, via email or SMS).

The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Banking Provider in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Banking Provider. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us to charge your Account and remit payment from your chosen payment provider or, as set forth below, via ACH (your chosen payment method, the “Payment Method”). You may also have the option to make your Payment Method to Vergo be an electric debit or check from your bank account (Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) or e-check). If you choose ACH as your Payment Method, the applicable Banking Provider may give you options for one-time payments and/or automatic recurring payments. Vergo will facilitate your transaction according to the information you provide to the Banking Provider. If you choose ACH as your Payment Method, you hereby authorize Vergo to debit your Billing Account via ACH for any Paid Services, and you agree that these terms and your use of the Services constitutes your authorization to Vergo to debit your Billing Account. Furthermore, if you choose ACH as your Payment Method, you agree that you will be bound by the NACHA Operating Rules in effect at the time of the debit. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Banking Provider makes even if it has already requested or received payment.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(c)</sup><span class="underline">Payment Method.</span> The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(d)</sup><span class="underline">Recurring Billing.</span> Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO THE ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SERVICES.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(e)</sup><span class="underline">Current Information Required.</span> YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.

Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(g)</sup><span class="underline">Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.</span> Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your Account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to <span>Account settings</span>. If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR VERGO ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM. PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, VERGO WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(h)</sup><span class="underline">Reaffirmation of Authorization.</span> Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(i)</sup><span class="underline">Free Trials and Other Promotions.</span> Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at support@getvergo.com.<br/><br/><span class="bold">What if I want to stop using the Services? </span><strong><br/><br/>‍</strong>You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at support@getvergo.com; please refer to our Privacy Policy <a href="https://www.getvergo.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://www.getvergo.com/legal/privacy-policy</a> , as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. Vergo is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your Account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.

Either you or Vergo may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#x27;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(d)</sup> Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND VERGO WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Vergo are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Vergo over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND VERGO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(e)</sup> Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Vergo is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(f)</sup> Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 228 Park Ave S., PMP 76551, New York, NY 10003-1502 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your Account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(g)</sup> Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Vergo to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Vergo agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.<br/><br/><sup class="other">(h)</sup> Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Vergo.<br/><br/><span class="underline">Miscellaneous. </span>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Vergo may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Vergo agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Vergo, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Vergo, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Vergo in any respect whatsoever.<br/><br/>Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application, Licensed Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Vergo agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.<br/><br/><span class="bold">Title goes here.<br/><br/></span><sup class="other">(a)</sup> fuehfgiehfjvoishdxoighjewvoirsdhg<br/></p></div><div class="spacer-large"></div><div class="sign-up-parent mobile"><p class="bold">Sign up to our newsletter</p><div class="spacer-x-small"></div><div class="w-form"><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" method="get" class="form-2" data-wf-page-id="62ad9731371b05f687c0d5f5" data-wf-element-id="d97e0d89-0e18-efde-e8fd-062981f13e21"><input class="text-field-2 w-input" maxlength="256" name="email-2" data-name="Email 2" placeholder="Email" type="email" id="email-2" required=""/><div class="parent ab"><img src="../images/arrow-1.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Arrow" class="arrow-ab"/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button-3 w-button" value=""/></div></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
